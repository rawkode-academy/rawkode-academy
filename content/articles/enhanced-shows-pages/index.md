Discover your favorite shows with a beautiful new design featuring thumbnails,
episode counts, and improved navigation!

**What's New:**

- **Distinctive icon** - Shows now use a TV icon to distinguish them from
  individual videos
- **Episode thumbnails** - Each show card displays the latest episode's
  thumbnail
- **Episode counts** - See at a glance how many episodes are available
- **Latest episode info** - Quick preview of the most recent episode title
- **Host labels** - Clear "Hosted by:" labels so you know who's behind each
  show
- **Better empty states** - Shows without episodes display a friendly message
  instead of 404
- **Refined styling** - Enhanced header with "Original Series" badge and
  improved visual hierarchy

**Why This Matters:**

- **Better discovery** - Quickly identify shows that interest you with
  visual previews
- **Episode visibility** - Know exactly how much content is available before
  diving in
- **Improved UX** - Smooth hover effects and transitions make browsing more
  enjoyable
- **Show-first design** - Treat shows as distinct series rather than just
  video collections

Explore our growing collection of shows and never miss an episode!
