single-column layout** optimized for learning!

**What's New:**

- **Professional single-column layout** that puts focus on the content
- **Social engagement features** - React, share, and save videos (coming soon
  banner for now)
- **Tabbed interface** for Description, Transcript, and Resources with smooth
  animations
- **Compact technology pills** showing the technologies featured in each video
- **Improved responsive design** that works beautifully on all screen sizes
- **Enhanced typography and spacing** for better readability

**Why This Matters:**

- **Better learning experience** - Clean, distraction-free layout helps you
  focus on the content
- **Community engagement** - New social features will help build discussions
  around videos
- **Faster navigation** - Tabbed interface makes it easy to switch between
  description, transcript, and resources
- **Mobile-friendly** - Responsive design ensures great experience on any
  device

The new design creates a more professional and engaging video watching
experience that puts learning first!
