We've added a **powerful command palette** to enhance your navigation experience
on Rawkode Academy!

**What's New:**

- Press `Ctrl+K` (or `Cmd+K` on Mac) to instantly access the new command palette
- **Search and jump to any course, lesson, or resource** without clicking
  through menus
- **Execute common actions** like switching themes, accessing your profile, or
  finding documentation with just a few keystrokes

**Why This Matters:**

- **Lightning-fast navigation** - Find what you need in seconds, not minutes
- **Stay focused** - Keep your hands on the keyboard and maintain your
  learning flow
- **Improved accessibility** - Better support for keyboard-only navigation
- **Smart search** - The palette learns from your usage patterns to surface
  your most-used commands first

Whether you're a keyboard warrior or just looking for a faster way to navigate
the platform, the command palette puts everything at your fingertips. Try it out
by pressing `Ctrl+K` anywhere on the site!
