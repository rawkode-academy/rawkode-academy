## Welcome

Let the journey begin. We're walking through the depths of the compiler,
touch the build ecosystem, get up to speed with the features of the language to end up writing our own small WASM runtime.
I think the best way to start things is to talk a bit about the history of Rust.

### The history of Rust

Like many languages, Rust started out as a hobby project. Here's a small timeline of notable milestones:

* 2006
  * Graydon Hoare starts Rust as his pet project while working at Mozilla
  * Rust was initially written in OCaml
* 2009
  * Mozilla offially sponsors Rust for a potential safe browser engine
  * The OCaml based compiler is switched to an LLVM based backend
* 2012
  * Rust 0.1 is released for Windows, Linux and macOS
* 2015
  * Rust 1.0 drops
* 2016
  * The first version of Servo is released
  * Servo was developed in parallel with Rust. Both ecosystems participated from each other
* 2021
  * The Rust foundation is founded by AWS, Google, Huawei, Microsoft and Mozilla

Here's a small list of resources you can read more in-depth about the history of Rust:

* [Graydon Hoare - 10 Years of Stable Rust: An Infrastructure Story](https://rustfoundation.org/media/10-years-of-stable-rust-an-infrastructure-story/)
* [Clive Thompson - How Rust went from a side project to the world's most-loved programming language](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/02/14/1067869/rust-worlds-fastest-growing-programming-language/)
* [releases.rs - Rust Changelogs](https://releases.rs)

### How to get started with the development of Rust

Now let's get our hands dirty and install Rust on our machine.
I usually setup a new Rust installation with [Rustup](https://rustup.rs).
As I'm on macOS I use [homebrew](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/installation/other.html#homebrew),
but there's a lot more [installation methods](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/installation/other.html#other-installation-methods) you can choose from.

Rust has different release channels (`stable` is the default one, there's also `beta` and `nightly`),
so running `rustup default stable` for the first time installs the `stable` rust toolchain with tools like `cargo`, `rustc` and more.
After setting up the toolchain, we can run `rustc --version` to reveal the version of the Rust compiler.

> When you see the message "error: linker `cc` not found", you have to install the `C` linker e.g. by running `apt install cmake`

To see if the Rust compiler really works, we can write a small "hello rust" program, compile and run it:
```shell
echo 'fn main() { println!("🦀"); }' > hello_rust.rs
rustc hello_rust.rs
./hello_rust
🦀
```

As you notice, we have to surround the `println!()` with a `main` function to run properly.
What happens when we run `rustc` with the code without the function:
```shell
rustc hello_rust.rs
error: macro expansion ignores `{` and any tokens following
   --> /Users/icepuma/.rustup/toolchains/stable-aarch64-apple-darwin/lib/rustlib/src/rust/library/std/src/macros.rs:142:23
    |
142 |     ($($arg:tt)*) => {{
    |                       ^
    |
   ::: hello_rust.rs:1:1
    |
  1 | println!("🦀");
    | -------------- caused by the macro expansion here
    |
    = note: the usage of `println!` is likely invalid in item context

error[E0601]: `main` function not found in crate `hello_rust`
 --> hello_rust.rs:1:15
  |
1 | println!("🦀");
  |                ^ consider adding a `main` function to `hello_rust.rs`

error: aborting due to 2 previous errors

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0601`.
```

We ignore the first error for now (we'll cover macros later).
The one cool thing about the Rust compiler is, that we get really informative error messages.
For example, if we run `rustc --explain E0601`, we get:
```shell
No main function was found in a binary crate.

To fix this error, add a main function:

fn main() {
    // Your program will start here.
    println!("Hello world!");
}

If you don't know the basics of Rust, you can look at the Rust Book to get started.
```

Rust programs are organized in "crates",
where the `main` function is the entry point for a binary crate (e.g. our `hello_rust.rs`). Rust also has "library" crates,
which should not contain a "main" function (it is possible, but it's dead code unless you explicitely call it).
Libraries are typically used to distribute code, that might be used as a dependency in another crate.

Now we're able to compile and run Rust code. Let's see what's next :)

## What's next

Next module will be all about `cargo` and the Rust toolchain.
