## About this Course

I'm writing Rust with the help of all sorts of coding agents, I understand most of the written code but wanted to relearn everything from scratch.
So I try to teach myself and others the nooks and crannies of Rust. The modules will be 5-10 minutes so you can easily do one module per day / week.

## A few more words
* I'll do most of the examples on macOS, so some calls might differ on your system.
* I'd appreciate telling me what I can improve about this course, feel free to
  * either open a PR [here](https://github.com/rawkode-academy/rawkode-academy/issues/new)
  * or open a discussion [here](https://github.com/orgs/rawkode-academy/discussions/new?category=q-a)
