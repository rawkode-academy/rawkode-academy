## About this Course

I'm writing Rust with the help of all sorts of coding agents, I understand most of the written code but wanted to relearn everything from scratch.
So I try to teach myself and others the nooks and crannies of Rust. The modules will be 5-10 minutes so you can easily do one module per day / week.
