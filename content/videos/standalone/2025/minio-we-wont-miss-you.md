  This isn't about open source companies needing to make money. That's valid.
  This is about how MinIO systematically destroyed community trust through
  silent license changes, aggressive legal theatrics, gutted features behind a
  $96K paywall, and locking GitHub threads when people pushed back.


  From the quiet AGPL switch in 2019 to the Weka fiasco to abandoning Docker
  images during a critical CVE - the pattern is clear: shoot first, ask
  questions never.


  A billion Docker downloads. Years of community goodwill. All gone.


  If you're still on MinIO, it's time to look at SeaweedFS.
