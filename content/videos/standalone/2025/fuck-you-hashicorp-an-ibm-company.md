  HashiCorp archived the repo without warning. Here is why their excuse about
  "product market fit" is a lie.
description: >-
  On December 10th, HashiCorp—an IBM Company—officially archived the Cloud
  Development Kit for Terraform (CDK) with absolutely zero notice or
  deprecation window. While they claim the project didn't find "product market
  fit," the numbers tell a different story with over 250,000 weekly downloads
  on NPM alone.


  This move proves that you don't kill a project with millions of monthly users
  because nobody likes it; you kill it because it isn't selling enterprise
  licenses. The suggested "migration path" of synthesizing your TypeScript or
  Python to HCL insults the intelligence of everyone who chose code over
  configuration in the first place.


  Key takeaways:

  The Sudden Death: The repo is read-only and buried as of yesterday.

  The Numbers: Between NPM, Python, and Go, the user base was massive,
  contradicting HashiCorp's official reasoning.

  The Reality: To IBM, users are not a community; they are just a calculation
  on a spreadsheet.

  What Now: It is time to switch to Pulumi, generate JSON, or look at
  Crossplane.
