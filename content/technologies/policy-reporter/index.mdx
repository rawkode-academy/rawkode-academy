Policy Reporter is a Kubernetes policy report aggregation tool. It gathers policy reports generated by policy engines like Kyverno, OPA Gatekeeper, and others, providing a centralized view of policy compliance across your Kubernetes clusters. It offers a user-friendly interface to visualize policy violations, track trends, and quickly identify problematic resources. Policy Reporter helps teams improve security posture, enforce governance policies, and streamline auditing processes by providing a clear and concise overview of policy enforcement status.

Policy Reporter is an open-source Kubernetes tool designed to aggregate, visualize, and report on policy violations across your clusters. It provides a centralized overview of policy compliance by collecting policy reports generated by various policy engines, such as Kyverno, OPA Gatekeeper, and others that utilize the Kubernetes PolicyReport custom resource definition (CRD).

## Key Features

-   **Policy Report Aggregation:** Collects and aggregates `PolicyReport` CRDs from different policy engines within your Kubernetes clusters.
-   **Centralized Overview:** Provides a single pane of glass to view all policy violations, misconfigurations, and security risks across your entire Kubernetes environment.
-   **User-Friendly Dashboard:** Offers an optional web-based user interface for intuitive visualization of policy reports, enabling quick identification of problematic resources and trends.
-   **Metrics & Observability:** Generates metrics that can be scraped by Prometheus and visualized in Grafana, allowing for integration into existing observability stacks.
-   **Integration with Policy Engines:** Works seamlessly with popular policy engines like Kyverno, OPA Gatekeeper, and others that produce `PolicyReport` CRDs.
-   **Drill-Down Capabilities:** Allows users to drill down into specific policy violations to view detailed information about affected resources and remediation steps.
-   **GitOps Friendly:** Can be integrated into GitOps workflows to provide continuous feedback on policy compliance.

## Benefits

-   **Improved Security Posture:** Helps identify and address security misconfigurations and policy violations proactively.
-   **Enhanced Compliance:** Streamlines the process of auditing and demonstrating compliance with security standards and internal policies.
-   **Faster Incident Response:** Provides a clear and consolidated view of policy issues, accelerating the identification and resolution of security incidents.
-   **Operational Efficiency:** Automates the collection and reporting of policy compliance data, reducing manual effort.
-   **Better Collaboration:** Enables security, development, and operations teams to collaborate more effectively on policy enforcement.
-   **Increased Visibility:** Offers deep insights into the policy enforcement status of your Kubernetes clusters.
