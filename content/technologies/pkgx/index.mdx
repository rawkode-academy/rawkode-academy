pkgx is a fast, cross-platform package manager designed to simplify development environment setup. It excels at managing arbitrary toolchains, including those not found in system package managers. It solves the problem of dependency conflicts and inconsistent environments by providing isolated installations and deterministic builds. pkgx is particularly useful for scripting, CI/CD pipelines, and managing projects with complex dependency requirements, allowing developers to easily manage multiple versions of tools like Node.js, Python, and Go, without interfering with system-level packages or other projects.

pkgx is a universal package manager designed to simplify the management of developer toolchains and dependencies across various projects and environments. It allows developers to easily install and use different versions of software without conflicts, making development more consistent and reproducible.

## Key Features

-   **Universal Package Management:** Manages arbitrary toolchains and packages, even those not typically found in system package managers.
-   **Isolated Environments:** Installs tools in isolated environments, preventing dependency conflicts and ensuring project-specific dependencies are met.
-   **Deterministic Builds:** Aims for deterministic builds, ensuring that a given set of inputs always produces the same output.
-   **Version Management:** Easily switch between different versions of tools (e.g., Node.js, Python, Go) without interfering with system-level installations or other projects.
-   **Cross-Platform:** Designed to work across various operating systems, providing a consistent experience for developers.
-   **Developer-Friendly CLI:** Offers a simple and intuitive command-line interface for managing packages and environments.
-   **CI/CD Integration:** Simplifies CI/CD pipelines by providing a consistent and reproducible way to set up build environments.

## Benefits

-   **Eliminates "Works on My Machine" Issues:** Ensures consistency across development teams and environments.
-   **Simplified Dependency Management:** Manages complex dependency trees with ease, reducing setup time for new projects.
-   **Increased Developer Productivity:** Developers can quickly access and manage the tools they need, reducing friction in their workflow.
-   **Reduced Build Times:** By caching and reusing dependencies, pkgx can accelerate build processes.
-   **Enhanced Reproducibility:** Guarantees that applications can be built and run identically across different machines and over time.
-   **Cleaner System:** Avoids cluttering your system with multiple versions of tools or conflicting dependencies.
