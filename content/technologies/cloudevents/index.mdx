  why: >-
    It's such a simple thing but with that simplicity comes power, safety,
    security, more sleep. Use the spec as your basis for all service
    communications and just trust it. You'll thank me.
  spicyTake: >-
    CloudEvents is the boring standard that quietly deletes half your
    integration bugs, boosts your security, and lets you sleep through the
    night. The best things are simple and CloudEvents is basically melatonin for
    distributed systems.
