Gitea is a lightweight, self-hosted Git service written in Go. It provides a simple and efficient way to manage Git repositories, offering similar features to platforms like GitHub and GitLab but with the advantage of being self-hosted, giving users complete control over their code and data. Gitea is valuable for organizations that require enhanced security, compliance, or customization that isn't possible with public Git hosting services. It's often used for private software development, internal code management, and creating isolated Git environments.

Gitea aims to be easy to install and use, making it a practical choice for small teams, individual developers, and large enterprises alike. It supports features like code review, issue tracking, project management, and wikis, enabling teams to collaborate effectively. Its lightweight nature also makes it suitable for resource-constrained environments, such as Raspberry Pi devices or low-powered servers.
