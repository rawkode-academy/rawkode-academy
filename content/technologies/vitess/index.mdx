Vitess is a database clustering system for horizontal scaling of MySQL. It enables you to shard and scale MySQL databases without application-level changes. It's particularly well-suited for cloud-native environments where scalability, fault tolerance, and operational simplicity are critical. Vitess provides features like connection pooling, query rewriting, and traffic shaping, allowing you to manage large MySQL deployments efficiently.

Vitess helps organizations address the challenges of scaling MySQL beyond the limits of a single instance. It improves performance, reduces operational overhead, and enhances resilience. Common use cases include large web applications, SaaS platforms, and any database-driven application requiring high availability, scalability, and consistent performance.
