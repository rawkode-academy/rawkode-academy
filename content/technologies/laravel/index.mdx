Laravel is a free, open-source PHP web framework, designed for the development of web applications following the model–view–controller (MVC) architectural pattern. It aims to simplify common tasks used in web development, such as routing, sessions, caching, and authentication, making the development process faster and more efficient. Laravel emphasizes elegant syntax and developer experience, providing a robust set of tools and features that allow developers to build complex and scalable web applications with less effort. 

Its value lies in its speed of development, security features, and the availability of a large and active community, which contributes to extensive documentation and a rich ecosystem of packages and tools. Laravel is used for building a wide range of applications, from simple websites and blogs to complex e-commerce platforms, REST APIs, and enterprise-level applications.
