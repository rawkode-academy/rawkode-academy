name: "Kubescape"
description: |
  Kubescape is an open-source Kubernetes security platform that allows users to scan, analyze, and report on security risks in their Kubernetes deployments. It provides a comprehensive view of your cluster's security posture by identifying misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, and deviations from established security best practices like the MITRE ATT&CK framework, NSA/CISA hardening guidance, and the CIS benchmarks. Kubescape enables organizations to proactively prevent security incidents, improve compliance, and strengthen their overall cloud native security.

Kubescape is a comprehensive open-source security platform for Kubernetes that helps organizations enforce security best practices, identify misconfigurations, and manage vulnerabilities across their cloud-native environments. It provides full-lifecycle security for Kubernetes, from development to production runtime.

## Key Features

-   **Misconfiguration Scanning:** Scans Kubernetes configurations (YAML files, Helm charts, Live Clusters) against a wide range of security frameworks and benchmarks, including NSA/CISA Kubernetes Hardening Guide, MITRE ATT&CK, and CIS Kubernetes Benchmarks.
-   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Identifies known vulnerabilities in container images, providing a holistic view of risks from code to deployment.
-   **Compliance Management:** Helps achieve and maintain compliance with various industry standards by providing detailed reports and remediation guidance.
-   **Runtime Security (eBPF-based):** Utilizes eBPF to monitor application behavior at runtime, detecting anomalous activities and potential threats.
-   **Admission Control:** Integrates with Kubernetes admission controllers to prevent insecure configurations from being deployed to the cluster.
-   **Automated Remediation:** Offers auto-remediation capabilities to automatically fix identified misconfigurations.
-   **Policy Enforcement:** Define and enforce custom security policies tailored to specific organizational needs.
-   **Risk Analysis:** Provides a prioritized list of risks with actionable recommendations, enabling teams to focus on the most critical issues.
-   **AI Integration:** Leverages AI capabilities for enhanced security analysis and automation.

## Benefits

-   **Proactive Security:** Identifies and prevents security risks early in the development lifecycle, shifting security left.
-   **Improved Compliance:** Simplifies the process of achieving and maintaining compliance with security regulations and best practices.
-   **Enhanced Visibility:** Provides a centralized, comprehensive view of the Kubernetes security posture.
-   **Reduced Attack Surface:** Helps harden Kubernetes clusters and applications by eliminating misconfigurations and vulnerabilities.
-   **Streamlined DevSecOps:** Integrates seamlessly into CI/CD pipelines, automating security checks and empowering developers to build secure applications.
-   **Cost-Effective:** As an open-source solution, it offers powerful security capabilities without proprietary licensing costs.
