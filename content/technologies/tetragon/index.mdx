Tetragon is a powerful, eBPF-based security observability and runtime enforcement tool designed for Kubernetes environments. It enables deep visibility into security-relevant events, such as process executions, network activity, and system calls, with minimal overhead. By leveraging eBPF, Tetragon provides real-time monitoring and analysis of application behavior, allowing users to detect and respond to security threats, enforce security policies, and gain valuable insights into application performance.

Tetragon's primary value lies in its ability to provide fine-grained security observability within Kubernetes without requiring intrusive agents or modifications to application code. This allows security teams to quickly identify and mitigate security risks, improve compliance posture, and gain a better understanding of their application security landscape. Common use cases include threat detection, intrusion prevention, policy enforcement, and security auditing.
