  why: >-
    OTel is the Rosetta Stone of observability—a universal language that lets
    every service, regardless of runtime or platform, speak the same telemetry
    dialect. It slots into your code with minimal friction and gives you
    end-to-end signal without wrestling bespoke instrumentation stacks.
  spicyTake: >-
    If you're not using OpenTelemetry, you're effectively running a
    pre-observability stack straight out of 2010. In a world where
    instrumentation is a solved problem, opting out isn't retro, it's negligent.

OpenTelemetry is an open-source observability framework providing a set of APIs, SDKs, and tools for collecting telemetry data (metrics, logs, and traces). It aims to standardize how telemetry data is generated and collected, enabling developers to understand the behavior and performance of their software. OpenTelemetry provides value by allowing developers to instrument their applications once and export data to multiple backend observability platforms. This avoids vendor lock-in and provides greater flexibility in choosing the best tools for analyzing application performance.
