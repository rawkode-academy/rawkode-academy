description: |
  Crossplane is an open-source Kubernetes add-on that extends your Kubernetes cluster to become a universal control plane. It allows you to manage and provision infrastructure from various cloud providers, on-premise environments, and SaaS offerings using Kubernetes APIs and tooling. By defining custom resource definitions (CRDs), you can create reusable abstractions for infrastructure services, enabling application teams to self-service provision resources without needing to understand the underlying provider details.

Crossplane transforms your Kubernetes cluster into a "universal control plane", allowing you to manage and provision external infrastructure and managed services using Kubernetes-native APIs and tools.

## Key Concepts

-   **Universal Control Plane:** Extends Kubernetes to control not just applications, but also underlying infrastructure and cloud services (databases, message queues, object storage, etc.).
-   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Define your infrastructure resources declaratively using Kubernetes YAML, just like you define your applications.
-   **Custom Resources (CRs) & Controllers:** Crossplane introduces Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) for various infrastructure components. Its controllers watch these CRs and reconcile them with the actual external cloud or on-premise resources.
-   **Providers:** Providers are Kubernetes controllers that enable Crossplane to interact with specific external APIs (e.g., `provider-aws`, `provider-azure`, `provider-gcp`, `provider-helm`, `provider-sql`).

## How it Works

1.  **Install Crossplane:** Deploy Crossplane and the necessary providers (e.g., `provider-aws`) to your Kubernetes cluster.
2.  **Define Infrastructure:** Create Kubernetes Custom Resources (CRs) that represent the desired state of your external infrastructure (e.g., an AWS RDS instance, an Azure SQL database).
3.  **Reconciliation:** Crossplane controllers constantly observe these CRs and make API calls to the respective cloud providers to provision, configure, and manage the actual infrastructure resources.
4.  **Application Consumption:** Applications running in Kubernetes can then bind to these provisioned resources using Crossplane's binding mechanism.

## Benefits

-   **Self-Service Infrastructure:** Application developers can provision their own infrastructure without needing direct cloud credentials or understanding cloud-specific APIs.
-   **Unified API:** Manage both applications and infrastructure through a single, consistent Kubernetes API.
-   **GitOps Ready:** Infrastructure definitions can be version-controlled in Git, enabling GitOps workflows for infrastructure management.
-   **Abstraction:** Platform teams can create higher-level abstractions ("Compositions") to expose simplified infrastructure options to developers, while managing underlying complexities.
