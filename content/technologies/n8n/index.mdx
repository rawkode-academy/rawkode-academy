n8n is a fair-code workflow automation platform. It empowers users to connect different applications and services together without writing any code. It provides a visual, node-based editor to create and automate complex workflows, enabling businesses to streamline processes, integrate data, and automate repetitive tasks. It is self-hostable, allowing for greater control over data and security.

n8n's main use cases include automating marketing campaigns, synchronizing data between CRMs and other business tools, automating e-commerce tasks like order processing and customer support, building internal tools, and integrating with various APIs for custom solutions. It offers a wide range of integrations and custom functions to tailor the automation to specific needs.

n8n is a "fair-code" workflow automation platform that enables users to connect applications and services, automate tasks, and build complex workflows without necessarily writing code. It offers a visual, node-based editor for creating powerful automations, with the flexibility to extend functionality using JavaScript or Python when needed.

## Key Features

-   **Visual Workflow Editor:** Create complex workflows by dragging and dropping nodes and connecting them visually, making automation accessible to both technical and non-technical users.
-   **Extensive Integrations:** Connects with over 400 applications, APIs, and services (e.g., CRM, marketing tools, databases, messaging apps) out-of-the-box.
-   **Code Flexibility:** While primarily a low-code/no-code platform, n8n allows users to inject custom JavaScript or Python code snippets into workflows for advanced logic and custom integrations.
-   **AI-Native Capabilities:** Supports building AI agent workflows based on frameworks like LangChain, enabling integration with large language models and custom AI services.
-   **Self-Hostable:** Provides the option to self-host the platform, giving users full control over their data, privacy, and security.
-   **Enterprise-Ready Features:** Offers advanced features for enterprise use cases, including user management, advanced permissions, Single Sign-On (SSO), and air-gapped deployment options.
-   **Data Transformation:** Powerful capabilities to transform, filter, and manipulate data between different steps in a workflow.

## Licensing Model ("Fair-Code")

n8n operates under a "fair-code" licensing model, which distinguishes it from traditional open-source:
-   The core source code is available (hence "fair-code"), allowing self-hosting and modification.
-   However, commercial use (e.g., for revenue-generating activities) typically falls under the **Sustainable Use License** or the **n8n Enterprise License**, which requires a commercial subscription.
-   It is free for non-profit and personal use.
    Always refer to the official n8n website and GitHub repository for the most precise and up-to-date licensing information.

## Benefits

-   **Streamlined Operations:** Automate repetitive tasks and integrate disparate systems, improving operational efficiency.
-   **Increased Productivity:** Empowers both technical and non-technical users to build and manage automations quickly.
-   **Data Control:** Self-hosting options provide greater control over data sovereignty and security.
-   **Scalability:** Designed to handle a wide range of workloads, from simple personal automations to complex enterprise workflows.
-   **Flexibility:** Combines the ease of low-code with the power of custom code, adapting to diverse automation needs.
-   **AI Augmentation:** Leverage AI to enhance workflows and create intelligent automation solutions.
