  why: >-
    MinIO systematically destroyed community trust through silent license
    changes, aggressive legal theatrics, gutted features behind a $96K paywall,
    and locking GitHub threads when people pushed back.
  spicyTake: >-
    A billion Docker downloads and years of community goodwill, all gone.
    MinIO's community edition entering maintenance mode isn't a tragedy—it's
    the inevitable conclusion of treating your community as a liability
    rather than an asset.

MinIO is a high-performance, S3-compatible object storage system. Originally designed for cloud-native workloads, it became popular for self-hosted object storage due to its simplicity and S3 API compatibility.

## History of Controversy

MinIO's relationship with its community has been troubled:

- **2019:** Silent switch from Apache 2.0 to AGPL license
- **Legal Actions:** Aggressive pursuit of companies using MinIO, including the Weka fiasco
- **Feature Stripping:** Key features moved behind a $96K/year enterprise paywall
- **Community Hostility:** Locking GitHub issues when users pushed back on changes
- **Docker Abandonment:** Left Docker images unpatched during critical CVEs

## Technical Features

- S3-compatible API
- Erasure coding for data protection
- Bucket versioning
- Object locking for compliance
- Server-side encryption
- Multi-site replication (enterprise only)

## Alternatives

If you're evaluating object storage solutions, consider:

- **SeaweedFS** - Apache 2.0 licensed, community-friendly
- **Ceph** - Full-featured distributed storage
- **Garage** - Lightweight, geo-distributed storage
