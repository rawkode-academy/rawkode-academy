Grafana is an open-source data visualization and monitoring platform. It allows users to query, visualize, alert on, and explore their metrics, logs, and traces. It provides a unified dashboard for observing data from various sources, empowering teams to proactively identify and address performance issues, understand trends, and make data-driven decisions. Grafana supports a wide range of data sources, including Prometheus, InfluxDB, Graphite, Elasticsearch, and many more, making it a versatile tool for monitoring diverse infrastructure and application environments.

Grafana's value lies in its ability to aggregate and present data in a clear and actionable manner. It's widely used for creating custom dashboards, setting up alerts based on specific thresholds, and collaborating on shared visualizations. Common use cases include monitoring application performance, tracking infrastructure health, analyzing business metrics, and troubleshooting incidents.
