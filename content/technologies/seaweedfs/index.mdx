  why: >-
    SeaweedFS is a fast, simple, and scalable distributed file system with
    S3 compatibility. It's the community-friendly alternative to MinIO with
    a permissive Apache 2.0 license that won't change overnight.
  spicyTake: >-
    SeaweedFS might not have MinIO's marketing budget, but it has something
    more valuable: a license you can trust and a community that isn't
    treated like a legal liability.

SeaweedFS is a fast distributed storage system for blobs, objects, files, and data lake. It implements an object store with O(1) disk seek, a Filer supporting cross-cluster active-active replication, and Hadoop-compatible filesystem support.

## Key Features

- **S3 API Compatibility:** Drop-in replacement for S3-based workflows
- **O(1) Disk Seek:** Fast read performance regardless of file count
- **Filer:** POSIX-like file system interface with directory structure
- **Erasure Coding:** Efficient storage with data protection
- **Tiered Storage:** Hot, warm, cold data management
- **Cross-Datacenter Replication:** Active-active replication support

## Architecture

SeaweedFS separates metadata from data:

- **Master Server:** Manages volume servers and file ID allocation
- **Volume Server:** Stores actual file data in volumes
- **Filer:** Optional component providing file system semantics

## Use Cases

- Object storage for cloud-native applications
- Media and asset storage
- Backup and archival systems
- Data lake storage layer
- CDN origin storage

## Why SeaweedFS over MinIO?

- **Apache 2.0 License:** Permissive license with no surprise changes
- **Community-Friendly:** Active development without hostile legal tactics
- **Feature Parity:** S3 compatibility without enterprise paywalls
- **Transparent Roadmap:** Open development process
