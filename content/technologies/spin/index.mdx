Spin is an open-source framework for building and running fast, secure, and portable serverless applications on WebAssembly (Wasm). It is designed for developers who want to deploy applications quickly and easily to a variety of environments, from local machines to cloud platforms. Spin leverages Wasm to provide exceptional performance and security, while its component model simplifies application development and deployment. It enables developers to use familiar languages like Rust, Go, Python, and JavaScript (via TypeScript) and build event-driven functions and services for modern web applications.
