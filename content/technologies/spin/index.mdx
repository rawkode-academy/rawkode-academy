  why: >-
    Spin gives you a pragmatic gateway into a WASM-first future where
    components, portability, and language freedom are defaults rather than
    aspirations. It turns WebAssembly from an idea into a production-ready
    execution model that works alongside containers, not against them. The
    component model makes interoperability feel natural, and Spin makes
    deploying that model effortless.
  spicyTake: >-
    WASM is the next platform shift hiding in plain sight, and Spin makes that
    shift unavoidable. Engineers clinging to today’s comfort zones will wake up
    on the wrong side of history while the rest of the industry quietly moves
    on.

Spin is an open-source framework for building and running fast, secure, and portable serverless applications on WebAssembly (Wasm). It is designed for developers who want to deploy applications quickly and easily to a variety of environments, from local machines to cloud platforms. Spin leverages Wasm to provide exceptional performance and security, while its component model simplifies application development and deployment. It enables developers to use familiar languages like Rust, Go, Python, and JavaScript (via TypeScript) and build event-driven functions and services for modern web applications.
