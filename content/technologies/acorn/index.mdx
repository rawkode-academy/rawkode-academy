Acorn packaged applications and their dependencies into self-contained "Acorn" images to simplify running workloads on Kubernetes. It aimed to improve the developer experience by abstracting Kubernetes details and providing a consistent deployment workflow from local development through production.

The project is no longer maintained: the `acorn-io/runtime` repository is archived, acorn.io now redirects to Obot, and the hosted documentation has been taken down.

Acorn offered a higher-level application packaging model on top of Kubernetes, bundling services, configuration, and dependencies into a single artifact for simplified deployments.
