Lumigo is a cloud-native observability platform designed to help developers debug, troubleshoot, and optimize serverless and microservices applications. It automatically traces requests across distributed architectures, providing end-to-end visibility into performance bottlenecks, errors, and dependencies. This enables faster root cause analysis, reduced mean time to resolution (MTTR), and improved application reliability and efficiency.

Lumigo is an AI-powered cloud-native observability platform built to provide developers and operations teams with end-to-end visibility into complex distributed systems, especially serverless and microservices architectures. It automates the collection and correlation of traces, logs, and metrics to accelerate troubleshooting and optimize application performance.

## Key Features

-   **Intelligent AI-Powered Observability:** Leverages AI to automatically discover services, map dependencies, and pinpoint anomalies within distributed architectures.
-   **Distributed Tracing:** Provides automatic, end-to-end tracing of requests across microservices, serverless functions, and third-party APIs, offering a clear visual representation of transaction flows.
-   **Centralized Log Management:** Aggregates and correlates logs with traces and metrics, providing a unified view for faster debugging and root cause analysis.
-   **Comprehensive Metrics:** Collects and visualizes key performance indicators (KPIs) across your cloud environment, including latency, errors, and resource utilization.
-   **AI-Driven Troubleshooting:** Uses machine learning to identify the root cause of issues, suggest remediation steps, and reduce the Mean Time To Resolution (MTTR).
-   **Cost Optimization:** Offers insights into resource consumption and helps identify areas for cost reduction in cloud environments.
-   **Alerting & Anomaly Detection:** Configurable alerts and automated anomaly detection notify teams of critical issues in real-time.

<h2>Benefits</h2>

-   **Faster Root Cause Analysis:** By correlating traces, logs, and metrics, Lumigo dramatically reduces the time it takes to pinpoint the source of problems in complex systems.
-   **Improved Developer Productivity:** Empowers developers to quickly debug and test their applications in production-like environments.
-   **Enhanced Application Reliability:** Proactive monitoring and faster incident response lead to more stable and reliable applications.
-   **Reduced Operational Costs:** Optimizes cloud resource usage and can significantly lower logging costs compared to traditional solutions.
-   **End-to-End Visibility:** Gain a complete understanding of how requests flow through your distributed architecture.
-   **Simplified Serverless Debugging:** Specifically designed to address the unique challenges of debugging serverless functions and event-driven architectures.
