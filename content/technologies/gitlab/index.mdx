GitLab is a comprehensive DevOps platform delivered as a single application. It provides a complete lifecycle toolchain, from project planning and source code management (SCM) to CI/CD, security, and monitoring. GitLab enables development, security, and operations teams to collaborate effectively, accelerate software delivery, and reduce development costs.

GitLab's value lies in its unified approach, which streamlines workflows, increases visibility, and fosters collaboration across the entire software development lifecycle. Main use cases include version control, continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), issue tracking, code review, security scanning, and release management, ultimately empowering organizations to build, test, and deploy software faster and more efficiently.

GitLab is a unified DevOps platform that covers the entire software development lifecycle, from planning and source code management to CI/CD, security, and monitoring. It aims to provide a single application for all stages of software development, fostering collaboration and accelerating delivery.

## Key Features

-   **Source Code Management (SCM):** Git-based repository management, including version control, branching, and merging.
-   **Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD):** Integrated CI/CD pipelines to automate building, testing, and deploying applications.
-   **Issue Tracking & Project Management:** Tools for planning, tracking, and managing projects, including issues, epics, and agile boards.
-   **Code Review:** Built-in code review capabilities, discussions, and merge requests.
-   **Security Scanning:** Integrated security features like Static Application Security Testing (SAST), Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST), Dependency Scanning, and Container Scanning.
