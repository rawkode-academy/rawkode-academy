description: |
  Gitpod is an open-source platform for automated and ready-to-code development environments in the cloud. It spins up fresh, containerized dev environments for each task, allowing developers to start coding instantly from any browser, Git repository, or IDE. Gitpod integrates with popular Git providers like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket. 
  
  Gitpod eliminates the need for local environment configuration, reduces context switching, and enhances team collaboration by providing consistent and reproducible development environments. It is primarily used for web development, software development, and open-source contributions, enabling faster onboarding, improved code quality, and a more streamlined development workflow.

Gitpod, now transitioning to be known as Ona, provides automated and ephemeral cloud-based development environments. It allows developers to start coding instantly in a pre-configured, consistent environment directly from their browser or desktop IDE, seamlessly integrated with their Git workflow.

## Key Features

-   **Automated Development Environments:** Automatically spins up a fresh, ready-to-code development environment for each task or branch, eliminating manual setup.
-   **Cloud-Based:** Environments run in the cloud, accessible from any device with a browser, enabling true remote development.
-   **`devcontainer.json` & `.gitpod.yml`:** Defines the environment configuration using standards like `devcontainer.json` or Gitpod's own `.gitpod.yml`, ensuring reproducibility.
-   **Prebuilt Workspaces:** Pre-build environments in the background for frequently used branches or projects, significantly reducing startup times.
-   **Seamless Git Integration:** Integrates with GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket, allowing you to launch an environment directly from a pull request or branch.
-   **IDE Agnostic:** Works with VS Code (via browser or desktop), JetBrains IDEs, and other popular tools.
-   **Collaboration:** Facilitates collaborative coding and code reviews directly within the cloud environment.

## Benefits

-   **Instant Onboarding:** New team members can start contributing code in minutes, not days, by eliminating complex local setup.
-   **Reproducible Environments:** Ensures all developers work in identical environments, preventing "works on my machine" issues.
-   **Reduced Context Switching:** Allows developers to quickly switch between projects or branches with dedicated, pre-configured environments.
-   **Enhanced Productivity:** Streamlines the development workflow, freeing developers from environment management tasks.
-   **Cost-Effective:** Optimizes resource utilization by spinning up environments only when needed and automatically shutting them down.
-   **Security:** Provides isolated environments, enhancing security by separating development work from local machines.

## Note on Branding

As of late 2024, Gitpod is transitioning its branding to **Ona**. Users are encouraged to migrate to the Ona platform.
