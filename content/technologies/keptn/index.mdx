Keptn is a cloud-native, event-driven orchestration platform designed to automate the software delivery lifecycle. It provides a unified control plane for continuous delivery and automated operations, allowing teams to define and enforce SLOs (Service Level Objectives) and automate remediation actions when those SLOs are breached. Keptn leverages a declarative approach and GitOps principles to manage deployments, testing, and operations across diverse environments.

Keptn helps organizations improve software quality, accelerate release cycles, and reduce operational costs by automating tasks such as performance testing, canary deployments, and rollback procedures. It enables data-driven decision-making by providing insights into application performance and health, making it a valuable tool for implementing continuous delivery and continuous operations strategies.

Keptn is an open-source, event-driven orchestration platform that automates the entire software delivery lifecycle (SDLC) and operations for cloud-native applications. It helps teams achieve data-driven continuous delivery by integrating quality gates based on Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and automating remediation actions.

## Key Features

-   **Event-Driven Control Plane:** Keptn operates on an event-driven architecture, where events (e.g., code commit, deployment, test finished) trigger automated actions and workflows.
-   **Automated SLO-based Quality Gates:** Define Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and Service Level Indicators (SLIs) that Keptn uses to automatically evaluate the quality and performance of new deployments.
-   **Declarative Delivery:** Leverages a declarative approach, defining desired states and quality criteria in Git, supporting GitOps principles for deployments and operations.
-   **Automated Remediation:** Automates common operational tasks and remediation actions, such as rolling back a faulty deployment if SLOs are not met.
-   **Integration with Existing Tools:** Integrates seamlessly with a wide range of popular DevOps tools for CI/CD, testing, monitoring, and alerting.
-   **Cloud-Native & Kubernetes-Native:** Designed for Kubernetes and cloud-native environments, providing a highly scalable and resilient platform.
-   **Multi-Stage Delivery:** Orchestrates complex delivery pipelines, including performance testing, canary releases, blue/green deployments, and auto-rollbacks.

## Benefits

-   **Accelerated Release Cycles:** Automates numerous manual steps in the SDLC, enabling faster and more frequent releases.
-   **Improved Software Quality:** Enforces quality gates based on real-time data and SLOs, preventing regressions and ensuring application health.
-   **Reduced Operational Burden:** Automates operational tasks and remediation, freeing up SRE and DevOps teams.
-   **Data-Driven Decision Making:** Provides insights into application performance and health, enabling informed decisions throughout the delivery process.
-   **Consistent Deployments:** Ensures that applications are deployed consistently across diverse environments by leveraging declarative configurations.
-   **Enhanced Collaboration:** Promotes collaboration by providing a unified platform for delivery and operations.
