Cortex is a horizontally scalable, highly available, multi-tenant, long-term storage for Prometheus. It allows you to ingest and query metrics from multiple Prometheus servers, centralizing your monitoring data. This provides a global view across all your clusters and enables long-term retention of metrics beyond Prometheus's local storage limitations. It allows you to reliably store Prometheus data for years and efficiently query it, supporting advanced analytics and historical analysis.

Cortex provides a scalable, long-term storage solution for Prometheus metrics, solving the "global view" and "long-term retention" challenges of standard Prometheus deployments.

## Key Features

-   **Horizontal Scalability:** Cortex can run across multiple machines, allowing you to scale ingestion and query capacity independently.
-   **High Availability:** It supports replication of data, ensuring no single point of failure.
-   **Multi-Tenancy:** A single Cortex cluster can isolate data and queries for multiple independent tenants (e.g., different teams or customers), secured by authentication.
-   **Long-Term Storage:** Designed to store metrics for years, typically using object storage (like S3 or GCS) as a backend.

## Architecture

Cortex is composed of several microservices (Ingesters, Distributors, Queriers, Query Frontend, etc.) that work together to handle the read and write paths efficiently. This microservices architecture allows for fine-grained scaling based on your specific workload (e.g., heavy write vs. heavy read).
