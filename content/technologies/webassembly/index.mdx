  why: >-
    WASM gives you a post-container execution model without discarding
    containers: a universal, language-agnostic runtime that behaves like a
    Rosetta Stone for compute. You write in whatever language fits the problem,
    compile to a portable artifact, and run it anywhere from edge to cloud to
    browser. The component model elevates this further by letting WASM modules
    interoperate cleanly with each other and with non-WASM systems, turning
    composability into a first-class primitive.
  spicyTake: >-
    WASM represents the next major platform shift, and the component model is
    the inflection point. Engineers who cling to today's comfort zones will get
    left behind while WASM quietly becomes the new baseline for portable,
    modular compute.

WebAssembly (Wasm) is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. It is designed as a portable compilation target for programming languages, enabling deployment on the web for client-side scripting or on servers for cloud computing. WebAssembly's primary value proposition lies in its near-native performance, security, and cross-platform compatibility, allowing developers to build high-performance applications that can run in a variety of environments. 

Main use cases include accelerating web applications by running computationally intensive tasks client-side, enabling serverless functions with fast startup times, building blockchain applications with secure and sandboxed execution environments, creating cross-platform games, and embedding WebAssembly runtimes in other applications for extensibility and sandboxed execution.
