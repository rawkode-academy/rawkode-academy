Knative is a developer-focused serverless application layer which is a great complement to the existing Kubernetes application constructs. Knative consists of three components: an HTTP-triggered autoscaling container runtime called “Knative Serving”, a CloudEvents-over-HTTP asynchronous routing layer called “Knative Eventing”, and a developer-focused function framework which leverages the Serving and Eventing components, called "Knative Functions".

Knative is a Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) graduated project.
