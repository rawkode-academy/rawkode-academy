Namespace is a development-focused compute platform that just works. Namespace builds on Ephemeral Instances, our container-optimized cloud infrastructure that offers you most of the support you need, including persistent logs and metrics, lifecycle management, and root SSH access. And they’re fast. Creating an instance takes just a few second, making them great for testing and development. Namespace is cost-effective because it carefully orchestrates the underlying infrastructure for high utilization and automatically ensures that you only pay what you use - no need to manually manage the lifecycle. With Ephemeral Instances, you can run Kubernetes-based, Docker-based and containerd-based workflows. And intermix them. We provide the same features to all containers, regardless of their orchestration. Most importantly, Namespace works with your existing configurations and tools.

Namespace is a high-performance developer infrastructure platform that provides ephemeral, container-optimized cloud environments to accelerate development, build, and test workloads. It aims to eliminate setup and maintenance overhead, allowing developers to focus on writing code.

## Key Features

-   **Ephemeral Instances:** Offers on-demand, container-optimized cloud instances that are fast to create and destroy, ideal for testing and development workflows.
-   **Multi-Runtime Support:** Supports Kubernetes-based, Docker-based, and containerd-based workflows, with the ability to intermix them seamlessly.
-   **Remote Access:** Provides persistent logs and metrics, lifecycle management, and root SSH access for deeper debugging and control.
-   **High-Performance Builds:** Accelerates build processes with features like Turbo Docker Builds, remote caching for popular toolchains (Bazel, Nix, Turbo), and incremental runs via cache volumes.
-   **Integrated Observability:** Includes built-in metrics, logs, OOM detection, workflow analytics, and performance insights for continuous optimization.
-   **Multi-Platform Support:** Addresses multi-platform needs, including nested virtualization, Android emulation, and native macOS for CI jobs on Apple Silicon.
-   **Enterprise-Grade Security & Compliance:** Features SOC 2 Type 2 Attestation, SAML SSO, private endpoints, usage analytics, and audit logs.

## Benefits

-   **Accelerated Development:** Significantly speeds up the entire development lifecycle, from coding to testing and deployment.
-   **Cost Efficiency:** Optimizes infrastructure utilization and ensures payment only for actual usage, reducing cloud costs.
-   **Zero Setup & Maintenance:** Developers get a ready-to-code environment without manual setup or ongoing maintenance.
-   **Reproducible Environments:** Ensures consistency across development, testing, and CI/CD, eliminating "works on my machine" issues.
-   **Enhanced Developer Experience:** Provides a powerful, intuitive platform that integrates with existing tools and workflows.
-   **Scalability & Performance:** Built for high throughput and low latency, capable of handling demanding build and test workloads.
