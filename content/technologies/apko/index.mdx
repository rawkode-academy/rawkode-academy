description: |
  apko is a tool for building minimal, unprivileged container images. It emphasizes reproducibility and security by leveraging declarative configuration and cryptographic verification of all dependencies. Apko eliminates the need for Dockerfiles, offering a more streamlined and auditable process for creating base images and application containers.
  
  Apko provides value by reducing image size, improving security posture through a minimal attack surface, and enhancing reproducibility. Its main use cases include creating base images for Kubernetes deployments, building lightweight application containers, and facilitating secure software supply chains.

apko is a command-line tool for building OCI container images from APK packages. It is designed to replace traditional `Dockerfile` builds with a purely declarative approach, resulting in smaller, safer, and more reproducible images.

## Key Features

- **Reproducibility:** apko builds are fully reproducible. Given the same configuration file and source repositories, it produces a bitwise-identical image every time.
- **Security by Design:** It builds "distroless" style images by default—containing only the packages you explicitly request. This minimizes the attack surface and reduces vulnerability noise.
- **SBOM Generation:** Every build automatically generates a comprehensive Software Bill of Materials (SBOM), making it easier to track dependencies and comply with security standards.
- **No Dockerfiles:** Images are defined in declarative YAML, removing the need for imperative build steps and ensuring a cleaner build process.

## How It Works

Instead of running `RUN` commands in a Dockerfile, you define your image in a YAML file. This configuration specifies:

1.  **Repositories:** Where to fetch APK packages (e.g., Alpine Linux or Wolfi repositories).
2.  **Packages:** The list of packages to install.
3.  **Accounts:** Users and groups to create.
4.  **Entrypoint:** The command to run when the container starts.

apko then resolves the dependencies, fetches the packages, and assembles the filesystem layer-by-layer without needing a container runtime daemon.

## Integration

apko is often used in conjunction with **melange**, a tool for building APK packages from source. Together, they provide a complete pipeline for building secure software supply chains: `melange` compiles the software into APKs, and `apko` assembles those APKs into a final OCI image.
