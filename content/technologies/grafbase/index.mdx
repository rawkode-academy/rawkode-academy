name: "Grafbase"
description: |
  Grafbase is a serverless GraphQL edge data platform designed to simplify and accelerate data access for frontend applications. It allows developers to connect to various data sources (databases, APIs, and content management systems) and expose them through a unified, performant GraphQL API. Grafbase optimizes data fetching using edge caching, data federation, and efficient resolvers, reducing latency and improving the user experience. 
  
  Grafbase provides tools for schema management, data modeling, and authentication, enabling developers to build and deploy GraphQL APIs quickly. It is particularly valuable for building data-intensive applications that require fast response times and easy access to diverse data sources. Common use cases include e-commerce platforms, content-rich websites, and mobile applications.

Grafbase is an enterprise-grade, serverless GraphQL edge data platform that provides a unified control plane for managing and governing APIs and AI stacks. It simplifies the process of building and deploying performant GraphQL APIs that can federate data from diverse sources and serve them globally at the edge.

## Key Features

-   **GraphQL Federation:** Unifies disparate data sources (databases, APIs, CMS, streaming data) into a single, cohesive GraphQL API, simplifying complex microservice architectures.
-   **Serverless Edge Deployment:** Deploys GraphQL APIs to the edge, minimizing latency and maximizing performance for global applications.
-   **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Support:** Enables AI agents to query APIs using natural language, integrating AI directly into your data layer.
-   **Self-Hosting & Control:** Offers options for self-hosting, providing complete control over data environments for stringent security and compliance requirements.
-   **Rust-Powered Core:** Built with Rust for exceptional performance, delivering superior response times and efficient resource utilization compared to many alternatives.
-   **Extensions:** Allows developers to customize API operations with custom logic for authorization, authentication, data transformation, and federation of various data sources.
-   **Data Modeling & Schema Management:** Provides tools for defining and managing GraphQL schemas, ensuring type safety and consistency across your API.

## Benefits

-   **Accelerated Development:** Speeds up frontend development by providing a unified and performant data access layer.
-   **Unmatched Performance:** Edge deployment and a Rust-powered core ensure low latency and high throughput for GraphQL queries.
-   **Enhanced Security & Governance:** Offers robust control mechanisms, self-hosting options, and policy enforcement for secure API management.
-   **Simplified API Management:** Reduces complexity by federating multiple data sources into a single GraphQL endpoint.
-   **AI Integration:** Natively supports AI agent interaction with APIs, enabling new possibilities for intelligent applications.
-   **Scalability:** Designed to scale with your data and user base, maintaining performance even as complexity grows.
