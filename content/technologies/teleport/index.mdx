  why: >-
    Teleport gives you unified, identity-driven access to everything that
    matters: Kubernetes clusters, bare metal, cloud assets, and databases. It
    wraps auditing, OIDC, session recording, and shared terminals into one
    coherent access layer. Instead of a sprawl of SSH keys, VPN hacks, and
    tribal workflows, you get a clean, enforceable security boundary that scales
    with your infra and your teams.
  spicyTake: >-
    Anyone still hand-managing access like it’s the stone age is willfully
    ignoring reality. Teleport isn’t a luxury, it’s the baseline for modern
    security, and the longer teams resist adopting it, the more reckless they
    look.

Teleport is an identity-aware access proxy that consolidates access to servers, applications, databases, and Kubernetes clusters behind a single, unified platform. It eliminates the need for traditional VPNs and SSH keys, providing a more secure and auditable approach to infrastructure access. Teleport leverages short-lived certificates and integrates with identity providers (like Okta, Google Workspace, or Active Directory) to enforce authentication and authorization policies.

Teleport provides value by reducing the attack surface, simplifying compliance, and improving developer productivity. Its main use cases include secure remote access for engineers, privileged access management for administrators, and centralized auditing of all infrastructure access activities.
