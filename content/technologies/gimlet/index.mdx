Gimlet is an Internal Developer Platform (IDP) that aims to simplify application deployment and management on Kubernetes, enabling developers to self-serve their application needs without requiring deep Kubernetes expertise. It streamlines the entire deployment workflow, from code to production, and integrates with existing CI/CD pipelines.

## Key Features

-   **Self-Service Deployments:** Developers can deploy their applications with a few clicks or commands, reducing reliance on platform teams for every deployment.
-   **Environment Management:** Centralized management of application environments, allowing platform engineers to define and enforce policies and guardrails.
-   **GitOps Integration:** Integrates with GitOps workflows to manage Kubernetes manifests, ensuring that the desired state of applications is always synchronized from Git.
-   **Rollback Capabilities:** Provides easy rollback mechanisms to revert to previous versions of applications in case of issues.
-   **Preview Environments:** Supports the creation of ephemeral preview environments for pull requests, enabling early testing and feedback.
-   **Simplified Interface:** Offers a user-friendly interface and CLI to interact with Kubernetes, abstracting away much of the underlying complexity.

## Benefits

-   **Increased Developer Velocity:** Accelerates the deployment process, allowing developers to iterate faster and deliver features more quickly.
-   **Reduced Cognitive Load:** Lowers the barrier to entry for developers working with Kubernetes, as they don't need to be Kubernetes experts.
-   **Improved Consistency & Governance:** Ensures that deployments adhere to organizational standards and policies through centralized controls.
-   **Enhanced Collaboration:** Streamlines communication and workflows between development, operations, and QA teams.
-   **Operational Efficiency:** Automates repetitive deployment tasks, freeing up platform engineers to focus on higher-value initiatives.
