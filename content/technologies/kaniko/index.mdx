Kaniko is a tool to build container images from a Dockerfile, inside a container or Kubernetes cluster. Unlike Docker-in-Docker (DinD), Kaniko doesn't depend on a Docker daemon and executes each command in the Dockerfile completely in userspace. This allows building images in environments that can't easily or securely run a Docker daemon, such as Kubernetes clusters. Kaniko significantly enhances security and portability by eliminating the need for privileged containers or Docker daemon access during the image building process.

Its primary use cases include building container images within CI/CD pipelines running in Kubernetes, automating image builds in cloud environments where Docker daemons are not available, and enhancing the security of image builds by avoiding privileged mode.

Kaniko is an open-source tool developed by Google that enables building container images from a Dockerfile, entirely within a container or a Kubernetes cluster, without relying on a Docker daemon. This approach addresses key security and operational challenges associated with traditional Docker builds in cloud-native environments.

## Key Features

-   **Daemonless Builds:** Unlike traditional Docker builds, Kaniko does not require a Docker daemon. It executes each command in the Dockerfile in userspace within the container, making it ideal for environments where running a Docker daemon is not feasible or desirable (e.g., in CI/CD pipelines within Kubernetes).
-   **Security:** Eliminates the need for privileged containers (like Docker-in-Docker) and Docker socket access, significantly reducing the attack surface and enhancing the security of your build processes.
-   **Reproducibility:** Kaniko aims for reproducible builds by executing Dockerfile commands sequentially and capturing changes to the filesystem.
-   **Cloud-Native Integration:** Designed to work seamlessly within Kubernetes and other containerized environments, making it a natural fit for cloud-native CI/CD pipelines.
-   **Flexible Build Contexts:** Supports various sources for the build context, including local directories, GCS, S3, and Git repositories.
-   **Layer & Base Image Caching:** Provides efficient caching mechanisms for layers and base images to speed up subsequent builds.
-   **Multi-Registry Support:** Can push built images to multiple container registries, including Docker Hub, Google Container Registry (GCR), Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR), and Azure Container Registry (ACR).

## How it Works

Kaniko is typically run as a container. You provide it with a Dockerfile, a build context, and a destination for the built image. Kaniko then:

1.  Fetches the base image specified in the Dockerfile.
2.  Executes each instruction in the Dockerfile step-by-step.
3.  Each command's outcome is committed as a new layer.
4.  Finally, pushes the completed image to the target container registry.

## Benefits

-   **Enhanced Security:** Build images in non-privileged containers, reducing security risks in shared environments.
-   **Simplified CI/CD:** Streamlines container image builds in Kubernetes-native CI/CD pipelines (e.g., Tekton, Argo Workflows).
-   **No Docker Daemon Dependency:** Eliminates the overhead and complexity of managing a Docker daemon on build agents.
-   **Improved Portability:** Builds are isolated and self-contained, ensuring consistency across different build environments.
-   **Faster Feedback Loops:** Enables quick and efficient image builds directly within your cluster.
