Komodor is a Kubernetes troubleshooting platform designed to help DevOps engineers and developers quickly resolve incidents and maintain cluster health. It provides a centralized view of Kubernetes events, metrics, and logs, combined with automated root cause analysis and remediation recommendations. The platform aims to reduce the mean time to resolution (MTTR) for Kubernetes issues by surfacing relevant data and simplifying complex debugging processes. Common use cases include incident response, proactive monitoring, performance optimization, and overall Kubernetes cluster management.

Komodor is a commercial Kubernetes troubleshooting and operations platform that leverages AI to help DevOps engineers and developers quickly identify, diagnose, and resolve issues within their Kubernetes environments. It provides a unified view and automates many aspects of incident response and cluster management.

## Key Features

-   **Autonomous AI SRE:** Powered by Klaudia AI, Komodor proactively detects and helps remediate issues, optimizing the reliability and performance of Kubernetes infrastructure.
-   **Centralized Observability:** Aggregates and correlates data from various Kubernetes sources (events, logs, metrics, deployments, configurations) into a single, intuitive dashboard.
-   **Automated Root Cause Analysis:** Automatically analyzes incidents and provides insights into the probable root causes, reducing the mean time to resolution (MTTR).
-   **Contextual Troubleshooting:** Enriches Kubernetes events and data with relevant context, making it easier to understand the state of applications and infrastructure.
-   **Deployment Tracking:** Monitors deployments and changes, quickly identifying issues introduced by new releases.
