Daytona is an open-source Cloud Development Environment (CDE) manager designed to streamline the provisioning and management of developer workspaces. It helps teams create consistent, isolated, and on-demand development environments that can be accessed from anywhere.

## Key Features

-   **On-Demand Environments:** Developers can spin up pre-configured development environments instantly, reducing setup time and eliminating "works on my machine" issues.
-   **Consistency:** Ensures that every developer and CI/CD pipeline operates in an identical environment, minimizing discrepancies and improving collaboration.
-   **Isolation:** Each development environment is isolated, preventing conflicts between projects and ensuring a clean workspace.
-   **Container-Native:** Leverages containers for packaging environments, making them portable and reproducible across different infrastructures.
-   **Infrastructure Agnostic:** Can be deployed on various cloud providers or on-premise, integrating with existing infrastructure.
-   **Integrated Tooling:** Provides integrations with popular developer tools and IDEs, offering a seamless experience.

## Benefits

-   **Accelerated Onboarding:** New team members can become productive immediately without complex local setup.
-   **Improved Productivity:** Developers spend less time configuring environments and more time coding.
-   **Enhanced Security:** Centralized management and isolated environments can improve security posture.
-   **Cost Efficiency:** Optimize resource utilization by spinning up environments only when needed and tearing them down when not in use.
-   **Remote Development:** Facilitates remote and distributed team collaboration by providing standardized access to development environments.
