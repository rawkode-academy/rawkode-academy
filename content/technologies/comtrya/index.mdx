Comtrya is a modern, fast, and cross-platform configuration management tool written in Rust, specifically designed for managing developer environments and dotfiles.

## Why Comtrya?

-   **Speed:** Built with Rust, it executes configuration tasks incredibly fast.
-   **Simplicity:** Uses YAML for configuration, making it easy to read and write without learning a complex DSL.
-   **Idempotency:** Ensures that running the tool multiple times produces the same result, only making changes when necessary.
-   **No Dependencies:** Being a single binary, it doesn't require a complex setup or runtime environment like Python or Ruby.

## Use Cases

-   **Dotfiles Management:** Symlinking and managing configuration files for your shell, editor, and tools.
-   **Package Installation:** Automating the installation of packages via Homebrew, apt, cargo, etc.
-   **System Setup:** Bootstrapping a new machine with all your required tools and settings in minutes.
