# Privacy Policy

*Last updated: December 2025*

Rawkode Academy is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding your data.

## Information We Collect

### Analytics Data

When you consent to analytics, we collect anonymized usage data including pages visited, time spent on site, and general geographic region. This data is collected via PostHog and helps us understand how visitors use our site to improve the learning experience.

### Newsletter Subscriptions

If you subscribe to our newsletter, we collect your email address. This is used solely to send you updates about new content, courses, and community events.

### Account Information

If you create an account, we store the information provided during sign-up, including your email address and any profile information you choose to add.

## How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect to:

- Improve our website and learning content based on usage patterns
- Send newsletters and updates to subscribers
- Provide personalized learning experiences for registered users
- Respond to your inquiries and support requests
- Ensure the security and proper functioning of our services

## Third-Party Services

### Analytics

We use PostHog for analytics, which only activates after you provide consent via our cookie banner. No tracking occurs without your explicit permission.

### Video Content

We host our own video content. When you watch videos on our site, we collect playback analytics (play, pause, seek, and completion events) to understand viewing patterns and improve our content. This data is associated with your session but not linked to personally identifiable information unless you are signed in.

### Authentication

We use secure third-party authentication providers. When you sign in, you are subject to those providers' privacy policies.

## Data Retention

Analytics data is retained in aggregate form and does not contain personally identifiable information. Newsletter subscriptions remain active until you unsubscribe. Account data is retained for as long as your account is active. You can request deletion of your data at any time by contacting us.

## Your Rights

You have the right to:

- Decline analytics tracking via our consent banner
- Unsubscribe from our newsletter at any time
- Request access to your personal data
- Request correction or deletion of your data
- Withdraw consent for data processing

## Cookies

We use minimal cookies necessary for site functionality. Analytics cookies are only set after you provide consent. You can manage your cookie preferences through our consent banner or your browser settings.
